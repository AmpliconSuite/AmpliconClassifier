### Classify [AmpliconArchitect](https://github.com/jluebeck/AmpliconArchitect) outputs to predict types of focal amplifications present.

This tool classifies the outputs of [AmpliconArchitect](https://github.com/AmpliconSuite/AmpliconSuite-pipeline).

If using AmpliconClassifier, please cite the following publication which describes the AmpliconClassifier methodology in the [Supplementary Information](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-023-05937-5/MediaObjects/41586_2023_5937_MOESM1_ESM.pdf) section:

### 1. Installation

AmpliconClassifier is included with [AmpliconSuite-pipeline](https://github.com/AmpliconSuite/AmpliconSuite-pipeline), but for re-classification, you may wish to keep a standalone installation of this module, using the instructions below.

#### Requirements
- Either python 2.7+ or python 3.0+
- `intervaltree` and `scipy` python libraries:  
>`conda install intervaltree scipy`  # or `pip install intervaltree scipy`
- `$AA_DATA_REPO` environment variable and data repo files. See instructions [here](https://github.com/AmpliconSuite/AmpliconArchitect#setting-up-the-aa-data-repo). 
- (optional) `matplotlib`: `conda install matplotlib-base` or `pip install matplotlib`

Mac users will need to perform one additional installation step:
```bash
brew install coreutils
```

#### Setup:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jluebeck/AmpliconClassifier.git
cd AmpliconClassifier
echo export AC_SRC=$PWD >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```



### 2. Usage

`amplicon_classifier.py` takes a collection of (or single) AA graph files and corresponding AA cycles file as inputs.

**To classify a single amplicon**:

>`python amplicon_classifier.py --ref GRCh38 --cycles sample_amplicon1_cycles.txt --graph sample_amplicon1_graph.txt > classifier_stdout.log`

**Most common - classifying multiple amplicons:**
You can provide the directory containing multiple AA amplicons or multiple uniquely named samples
>`python amplicon_classifier.py --ref GRCh38 --AA_results /path/to/AA/output/directories/ > classifier_stdout.log`

AC will crawl the given location and find all relevant AA files and perform classification on them.

**Less common - separate usage of `make_input.sh`:**

Alternatively, you can use the `make_input.sh` script to gather the necessary input files outside of AC:

`make_input.sh` takes a path and an output prefix. e.g:

>`make_input.sh /path/to/AA/output/directories/ example_collection` 

This will create a file called `example_collection.input` which can be given as the `--input` argument for AC.


#### Combining classification results from GRCh37 and hg19:

If combining data from both GRCh37 and hg19 in the same classification run, you can set the flag `--add_chr_tag` to add the "chr" prefix to each chromosome name and effectively unify everything as hg19-based.

### 3. Outputs

#### ****`[prefix]_amplicon_classification_profiles.tsv`**** 

Contains an abstract classification of the amplicon, and also indicates in separate columns "BFB+" and "ecDNA+" status.
Note that amplicons receiving a "Cyclic" classification may be ecDNA+, BFB+ or both.

| `amplicon_number`              | AA amplicon index, e.g. `amplicon2`                                                                                                                                        |
| `amplicon_decomposition_class` | Abstract description of the AA amplicon type. Note that `Cyclic` can refer to either BFB or ecDNA. Please see the following columns for that distinction.                                                                                    |
| `ecDNA+`                       | Prediction about whether the AA amplicon contains ecDNA. Note, an AA amplicon may contain regions surrounding the ecDNA, or multiple linked ecDNA. Either `Positive` or `None detected` |
| `BFB+`                         | Prediction about whether the AA amplicon is the result of a BFB. Either `Positive` or `None detected`                                                                                   |

Because an ecDNA may overlap with a BFB, they are reported separately.

#### ****`[prefix]_gene_list.tsv`****
Reports the genes present on amplicons with each classification, and which genomic feature (e.g. ecDNA_1, BFB_1, etc), it is located on, along with the copy number and which end(s) of the gene have been lost ("truncated"), will be one of `None`, `5p` (5-prime end), `3p` (3-prime end) or `5p_3p` if both. Genes are sourced from RefGene and most lncRNAs and micro-RNAs are excluded from the report.

The possibilities for ecDNA context classification are

| ecDNA context class                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Simple circular simple background   | A simple ecDNA cycle with minimal rearrangements in the surrounding genome. Likely not derived from chromothripsis.                                                                              |
| Simple circular complex background  | A simple ecDNA cycle however there are genomic rearrangements in the vicinity outside the ecDNA region.                                                                                          |
| BFB-like | ecDNA possibly derived from a BFB.                                                                                                                                                               |
| Two-foldback | ecDNA being flanked by two foldback-like SVs. Likely not derived from chromothripsis, but possibly from [ODIRA](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002016). |
| Heavily rearranged unichromosomal | ecDNA from a heavily rearranged genome on one chromosome. Possibly due to chromothripsis. |
| Heavily rearranged multichromosomal | ecDNA from a heavily rearranged genome involving multiple chromosomes. Possibly due to chromothripsis and chromoplexy. |
| Unknown | Does not match any of the classes above. |

#### Amplicon bed files, annotated cycles, and SV summaries
Additionally, there are three directories  created by `amplicon_classifier.py`. They are
- `[prefix]_classification_bed_files/`, which contains bed files of the regions classified into each feature. May contain bed files marked `unknown` if the region could not be confidently assigned.
  - The bed files report genomic intervals using a [0-based, half-open counting system](https://genome-blog.soe.ucsc.edu/blog/2016/12/12/the-ucsc-genome-browser-coordinate-counting-systems/). This is the same system used by the UCSC genome browser.
  - By contrast, AmpliconArchitect's graph and cycles files report genomic coordinates using a 0-based, fully closed counting system. This means that intervals reported by AC will contain one additional base on the second coordinate, which is not part of the amplicon (half-open).
  - Intervals reported in these bed files do not represent the structure of ecDNA, and may face limitations related to missing SVs or inexactly refined amplicon endpoints (a limitation of short-reads).

- `[prefix]_SV_summaries/`, which contains tab-separated files summarizing the SVs detected by AA and what features the overlap in the amplicon.
- `[prefix]_annotated_cycles_files/`, which contains AA cycles files with additional annotations about length of discovered paths/cycles and their classification status. Using these annotated cycles files is preferred over the unannotated cycles file produced by AA. These cycles are filtered to remove cycles overlapping low-complexity regions of the genome, patches reference genome issues, and filters duplicate cycle entries erroneously output by AA (uncommon).


### 4. Command-Line Options

If running AC only on a single AA amplicon, use arguments:
- `-c/--cycles`: AA cycles file
- `-g/--graph`: AA graph file

Else if running on multiple amplicons, use argument
- `--AA_results`: Path to a directory containing one or more AA results. AC will search this directory recursively and index all the AA results it finds for classification.

### 5. Other utilities:

#### Feature Similarity
One may wish to compare two overlapping focal amplifications and quantify their similarity - particularly when they are derived from multi-region 
or longitudinal sampling. We provide a script which ***a)*** identifies overlap between pairs of amplicons (using the same input file as `amplicon_classifier.py`), 
***b)*** computes measurements of the similarity of the two overlapping amplicons based on shared breakpoints and shared genomic content - 
using both a Jaccard index approach and also our own *Symmetric Similarity Score* and *Asymmetric Similarity Score* approaches, and ***c)*** compares the scores against
the similarity scores for overlapping amplicons derived from unrelated origins (data derived from Turner et al. _Nature_ 2017 and deCarvalho et al. _Nature Genetics_ 2018, Bergstrom et al. _Nature_ 2020 and Paulson et al. _Nature Communications_ 2022).
The output file `*_similarity_scores.tsv` reports the following columns:
- Amplicon 1 ID & Amplicon 2 ID
- Symmetric Similarity Score (a combination of GenomicSegment and Breakpoint scores)
- Percentile and P-value of the Sym. Score in the background unrelated overlapping amplicon distribution. P-value based on beta distribution fit to similarity scores.
- `GenomicSegmentScore1` & `GenomicSegmentScore2` based on the directional similarity of genomic segment overlap (Amp1 and Amp2)/(Amp1) or (Amp1 and Amp2)/(Amp2), respectively.
- `BreakpointScore1` & `BreakpointScore2` based on the directional similarity of breakpoint matching (Amp1 and Amp2)/(Amp1) or (Amp1 and Amp2)/(Amp2), respectively.
- `JaccardGenomicSegment`, based on overlap of genomic segments (based on overlap of genomic coordinates)
- `JaccardBreakpoint`, based on overlap from matching of breakpoints.

The primary difference between `amplicon_similarity.py` and `feature_similarity.py` is that the latter only considers regions annotated as specific classification features (e.g. ecDNA, BFB) when computing similarity scores.

**Example command for `feature_similarity.py`**
```shell
$AC_SRC/feature_similarity.py --ref hg38 -f [sample]_features_to_graph.txt --required_classifications [default "any", but can be "ecDNA", "BFB", "CNC", "linear" or any combination of those] 
```
Where "[sample]_features_to_graph.txt" is one of the output files generated by `amplicon_classifier.py`. `--include_path_in_features` is useful for comparing two runs with the same sample names 
(after combining both `_features_to_graph.txt` files from each run into one file).

**How do I use this to perform similarity score-based filtering on my samples?**
To remove potential false-positive focal amplificaiton calls from a collection of samples, we can use the similarity scores and p-value reported by AC. The motivating idea is that in unrelated samples, precisely conserved CN boundaries and SVs should be exceptionally rare unless they are derived from issues with the reference genome. If all samples in the collection are from unrelated sources (no replicates, no multi-region or longitudinal samples, etc.) users can simply run AC on the batch of samples setting the `--filter_similar` flag. However, if the collection contains a mixture of samples from related and unrelated sources, then some samples will likely have focal amplifications having a high degree of similarity due to being from related origins. In this case, users can run the `feature_similarity.py` script described above on the samples to produce a table of similarity scores and p-values. Users can then filter highly similar focal amplifications from unrelated samples using the p-value in the table. Since this involves multiple hypothesis testing, to control false positive rate, users can mirror what is done by internally by AC and apply a slightly modified Bonferroni correction of `alpha/(n-1)` where alpha by default is 0.05 and `n` is the number of samples in the collection having a focal amplification. 

**Info about accessing the legacy version of AmpliconClassifier:**

For the legacy version used in [Kim et al., *Nature Genetics*, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0678-2) please see the scripts and README in the "legacy_natgen_2020" folder of this repo.
The legacy version is only recommended for reproducing the paper results, and not for state-of-the-art amplicon classification. The legacy version was developed by Nam Nguyen, Jens Luebeck, and Hoon Kim.
The current version was developed by Jens Luebeck and Bhargavi Dameracharla.
