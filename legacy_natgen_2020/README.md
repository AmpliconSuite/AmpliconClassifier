## Classifying the amplicons generated by AmpliconArchitect



```
./classify_amplicon.py -d ${AMPLICON_DIR} -p ${AMPLICON_SAMPLE_ID} -o ${AMPLICON_SAMPLE_ID}_amplicon_classification.txt
```

**AMPLICON_DIR** : A full directory path containing all output files from a sample after running AmpliconArchitect with the sample.

**AMPLICON_SAMPLE_ID**: ID that was used when running AmpliconArchitect with a sample. For example, if you have an output file name like `sample1_amplicon1_cycles.txt`, `sample1` should be **AMPLICON_SAMPLE_ID**





## Calling BFB using the outputs from AmpliconArchitect



```
./bfb_foldback_detection.py --ref ${GENOME_BUILD} --AA_graph_list ${GRAPH_LIST_TABLE_PATH} -o ${OUTPUT_NAME} --exclude ${BFB_EXCLUDE_BED}
```



**GENOME_BUILD**:  `hg19`, `GRCh37`,  or`GRCh38`. Default is `GRCh37`

**GRAPH_LIST_TABLE_PATH**: A full path to a tab delimited file containing information on the graph files generated from AmpliconArchitect. An example table is:

| sample1_amplicon1 | path_to/sample1_amplicon1_graph.txt |      |      |      |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| sample1_amplicon2 | path_to/sample1_amplicon2_graph.txt |      |      |      |
| sample1_amplicon3 | path_to/sample1_amplicon3_graph.txt |      |      |      |

**BFB_EXCLUDE_BED**: A bed containg genome regions that we want to exclude.
